This is an adaptation of [fancy-git](https://github.com/diogocavilha/fancy-git),
tailored to my personal needs. 

I removed all the configuration options which I found not necessary for me
personally, and refactored the code with a more functional approach. That made
it easier for me to move blocks around, and customize their colors.

I just publish it, because why not.
